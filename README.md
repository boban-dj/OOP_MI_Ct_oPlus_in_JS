# OOP_MI_Ct_in_JS

### OOP, Multiple Inheritance, and Cascade thing, in JavaScript.

_Though written in context of the JavaScript, this might also be of particular interest in general, no matter what language you use._

_By "cascade thing" I mean cascading of styles (e.g. CSS), profiles, configuration, whatever else._

_This is the result of me trying to somehow grasp all-in-one and make a cheatsheet of OOP in JavaScript. Courtesy of w3school.com. I do know quite well, to say a least, what the OOP is and how it works in so many other languages, so here it was an attempt not to understand OOP (I already do), but to make a sense of what is what in JS specifically, and somehow get a whole picture of various ways and available means._

_This is in no way an attempt to explain OOP; rather, if you read this, it is expected that you are deeply familiar with all concepts of OOP, and know few languages where it is implemented differently. If so, this article will of interest and of use for you, and will be both a fun read, and will make you think._

Let's get started.
